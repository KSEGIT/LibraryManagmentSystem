C++ library management system with custom implemented AVL data structure

needs input file as argument for initialisation
example running command: "./library database.txt" or "./library books"


Scenario
A library has found their book search system has become slower as their collection of books has grown. They need you to design an efficient program which allows searching for books by title and adding and removing books. You will be provided with a sample of book data in a text file, which must be loaded by your program. It should however, be possible for your program to load data from another file, e.g. by using a command line argument of the file name, to allow them to later load the full list of all books in the collection.
